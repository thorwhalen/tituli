"""The composed pieces: title cards, captions with attribution, lower thirds.

Each function turns a few strings into a :class:`~tituli.layout.Layout` placed

knowledge allows. The pipeline order is fixed and matters: **shape/wrap →
measure → decide ink → cut the scrim to the measured block → compose**. A scrim
sized before the text is measured is how a three-line caption ends up hanging
