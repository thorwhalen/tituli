"""When overlays appear: timed overlays, and a scheduler that owns the rules.

Two ways in, both whole:

* **You schedule.** Build :class:`TimedOverlay` objects at the times you want
  and hand them to :func:`tituli.video.overlay`. tituli composites; it does
  not second-guess your times.
* **tituli schedules.** :func:`schedule_labels` derives one label per panel of
  a cut, with *first appearance*, *repeat gap* and *suppression by a heavier
  overlay* as first-class rules — and the suppression check lives **inside**
  the loop, so a label that loses its moment to a title card is not recorded
  as shown and gets its next chance. (That ordering bug once left the one
  portrait a cold viewer most needed named unlabelled for nine minutes.)

There is deliberately no middle: nothing here owns *some* of the timing and
leaves the caller to reconcile the rest.

A label is either a :class:`Label` or the explicit :data:`UNLABELLED` sentinel.
``None`` is refused: a still left uncaptioned next to a captioned one is an
implicit claim about what it is, so "no caption" must be said, never defaulted.

>>> spans = [Span(0, 5, "eliza"), Span(5, 10, "eliza"), Span(10, 15, "map")]
>>> labels = {"eliza": Label("Eliza Hamilton", "Ralph Earl, 1787"), "map": UNLABELLED}
>>> cards = [TimedOverlay(None, 0, 3, slot="top-left", weight=2)]
>>> out = schedule_labels(spans, lambda p: labels[p.key], suppressed_by=cards)
>>> [(round(o.start), round(o.end)) for o in out]   # first span lost to the card
