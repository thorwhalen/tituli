"""The shipped skill must survive the path CI takes: sdist first, wheel from it.

A wheel built straight from the working tree passes while the published one is
broken (hatchling dedupes the `.claude/skills/` symlink against the real file
and keeps the symlink's path in the sdist) — so this test builds the sdist,
unpacks it, and builds the wheel from *that*.
