"""Glyph outlines as SVG path data — the vector form of a placed :class:`Run`.

A :class:`~tituli.layout.Layout` says *where* each run goes; this module says
*what it looks like as geometry*: the font's own contours, scaled to the run's
face size, advanced along the run exactly as :meth:`Face.length` measures it,
rotated by the run's angle and translated to its baseline origin. The result is
an SVG ``d`` string in frame pixels (y down), so a caller can draw text with no
font engine at all — an animation runtime that only knows how to draw SVG, for
instance (thorwhalen/an#155: *glyphs as SVG sprites, converted at compile
time*).

>>> from tituli.fonts import EMBEDDED, resolve_face
>>> from tituli.layout import Run
>>> run = Run("Hi", 10.0, 50.0, resolve_face(EMBEDDED, size=40), (0, 0, 0, 255))
>>> out = run_outline(run)
>>> out.d.startswith("M")
True
>>> out.bbox.y1 <= 50.0 + 1 and out.bbox.y0 < 50.0   # ink sits on the baseline
True

Missing glyphs **raise** rather than drawing a box or nothing: a string the
face cannot set is the caller's decision (another face, other words), never a
silent substitution.

>>> run_outline(Run("é", 0, 0, resolve_face(EMBEDDED, size=40), (0, 0, 0, 255)))
